                <p>(ok, maybe only I find them to be wonderful. However, don't hold back from exploring this page. The only drawback is - you may feel like getting to know me better!)

                    <h2>Here's the story in a nutshell...</h2>
                    <p>I live in Melbourne, Australia</p>

                    <p>I lived in Los Angeles, California.</p>
                    <p>I lived in Singapore.</p>
                    <p>I own an Australian online small business named <a href="https://hampertree.com.au/">Hamper Tree.</a></p> 
                    <p>I am undertaking a Software Engineering course with <a href="https://academyxi.com/">Academy Xi</a> in the year 2021.</p>
                    <p>I graduated from the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego.</a></p>
                    <p>I served in the military for a few years.</p>
                    <p>I attended high school at <a href="https://www.sji.edu.sg/">St. Joseph's Institution.</a></p>
                    <p>I have a beautiful daughter born in the United States in 2019, a handsome dog and a lovely partner in life. You can see her and the dog on the left. My partner is staying anonymous just as a lucky lottery winner would.</p>
                    <p>I was a full-time Director of Household Affairs from 2019 to 2020.</p>
                    <p>I had previously worked in the commercial real estate industry in various roles such as property manager, facilities manager and sales executive.</p>
                    <p>I love to Travel. Some of my favourite countries to visit include <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/au/?gclid=CjwKCAjw55-HBhAHEiwARMCszttj0bxjqixgwmxWHCTT6UzGMPVYgXfEmqsyP22ZncvsbaZab7TchhoCmLEQAvD_BwE">Japan</a>, <a href="https://eng.taiwan.net.tw/">Taiwan</a>, <a href="https://www.germany.travel/en/home.html">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.visititaly.eu/">Italy</a> and the <a href="https://www.visitczechrepublic.com/en-US">Czech Republic</a>.</p>
                    <p>I always look forward to going home to England and Singapore to visit immediate family.</p>
                    <p>I devour all delicious food placed in front of me.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new dishes. Two of my favourite chefs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heston_Blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a> and <a href="https://adamliaw.com/">Adam Liaw.</a></p>
                    <p>I listen to pretty much all types of music except heavy metal.</p>
                    <p>I love attending live music concerts and musical theatre shows.</p>
